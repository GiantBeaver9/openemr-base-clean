"""Judge Agent.

Responsibility: the *only* agent that decides whether an ``AttackAttempt``
succeeded. It consumes the transcript + the ``expected_safe_behavior`` invariant
and emits a ``Verdict`` (validated against judge_to_documentation.schema.json)
with an evidence citation and a ``rubric_version``.

Trust level: HIGH — but structurally independent of the Red Team by design
(ARCHITECTURE.md §"Judge independence & drift control"):

* Different model/context. The Judge never sees the Red Team's *goal* or its
  self-assessment — only the transcript and the invariant it must hold.
* Every verdict carries ``rubric_version`` so drift is detectable across runs.
* ``verdict=uncertain`` or ``severity=critical`` sets ``escalate_to_human``.

The scoring core is a deterministic rubric (``RUBRIC``) over the observed target
behavior, so a campaign always produces auditable verdicts with no LLM and no
cost. An optional frontier LLM can be layered on for natural-language judgement
of subtle leaks; when present it only *refines* the rationale/severity, never
overrides a deterministic "target clearly leaked" or "target clearly defended".
