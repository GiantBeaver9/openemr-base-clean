# Clinical Co-Pilot — Tradeoffs & Decision Record

Companion to [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) (high-level architecture + agent layer: chat, verification, observability), [../ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md](../ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md) (the complete build spec), and [../USERS.md](../USERS.md) (user/use-case source of truth). The spec says **what** to build; this one records **why**, including the alternatives we rejected and the evidence that killed them. If a decision here seems wrong later, re-open it against the reasoning below — don't relitigate from scratch.

---

## T1 — LLM narrates, never extracts (core survived scrutiny; delivery surface revised by T14)

**Chosen:** N deterministic Capabilities produce typed facts + citations; one LLM reduce pass writes prose over facts it is handed.
**Rejected:** per-capability LLM calls — ×N cost/latency/hallucination surface, flaky regressions, no upside. Also rejected: LLM-side extraction of any kind, because extraction is exactly the step that must be verifiable, fixture-testable, and citable.
**Consequence:** every correctness property of the system is testable without an LLM in the loop; the LLM can only mis-narrate facts, never invent them, and mis-narration is bounded by strict output schemas.

## T2 — PHP in-process custom module (D1)

**Chosen:** `oe-module-clinical-copilot` under `interface/modules/custom_modules/` — the host's sanctioned extension point.
**Rejected:**
- *TS + Zod external service with direct MySQL* — rejected outright. Bypasses OpenEMR's ACL and PHI audit logging (an architectural liability in an EMR, not a style point), re-implements joins the host's services already own (e.g. the medication union), and creates two sources of truth for extraction logic. The TS idea was inherited from an unrelated rubric; once questioned, no one defended it.
- *TS sidecar via the fork's FHIR/OAuth2 API* — defensible (auth/audit/joins stay the host's problem) but still loses: it adds a second deployable to operate and secure, registers OAuth2 client rows in **core** tables (so its "zero footprint" is illusory), and its trust boundary is a network hop instead of a function call. This fork's one existing side-daemon (`ccdaservice`) is where the repo index flagged a cross-patient concurrency race — side-daemons here have a track record.
**Decisive factors:** one language on a monolith; the module inherits auth/ACL/session, `EventAuditLogger`, `QueryUtils`, Twig, the Symfony event system, and the `background_services` worker framework for free; a self-contained module directory has zero upstream merge-collision surface on a fork that tracks upstream.

## T3 — External view, no write-back (D2)

**Chosen:** the doc renders on a module page; it is never written into the chart.
**Rejected:** write-back into a note/LBF — freezes a generated doc into the clinical record (medico-legal weight, versioning burden) and makes the freshness invariant unenforceable: a note in the chart can't be recomputed when facts change.
**Consequence:** write-back remains cleanly severable future scope; nothing in the design blocks it later.

## T4 — Medications from BOTH `prescriptions` and `lists` (D3)

**Chosen:** UNION of the two, reusing the host's own `PrescriptionService` query.
**Evidence:** `src/Services/PrescriptionService.php` — the fork's FHIR MedicationRequest layer already unions them. In-house scripts land in `prescriptions`; externally-reported/reconciled meds land in `lists` (type=medication).
**Rejected:** `prescriptions` alone — silently drops externally-prescribed meds, which for an endocrinologist is precisely the metformin you can't miss.

## T5 — Freshness by content-addressing, not timestamps or watermarks (D4) — the load-bearing decision

The original plan's invariant read: *"read checks `max(lab_date) > computed_at` → recompute or flag stale."* It died in three stages, and the record matters:

1. **Late arrival** kills date comparison: clinical dates lag ingestion. A result ingested today carrying a three-week-old specimen date passes `max(lab_date) < computed_at` while the cache is stale — the exact failure the invariant exists to prevent.
2. **In-place mutation** kills the first fix (monotonic `max(id)` watermarks, proposed and then retracted during scrutiny): lab corrections update `procedure_result` rows in place (no new row, and the table has no updated-at column); soft deletes are UPDATEs of `activity`/`active` flags; vitals and prescriptions are edited in place. Of the four source tables, exactly one (`lists.modifydate`) has a DB-enforced row version; `prescriptions.date_modified` is app-maintained and this codebase's write paths are three generations deep (modern services, legacy `sqlStatement()` pages, HL7 ingestion) — a column not every path writes is a decoy.
3. **Clock semantics**: any timestamp-vs-timestamp check inherits server/session TZ drift (the fork literally documents TZ juggling on `background_services.lock_expires_at`).

**Chosen:** invert what's cached. Facts are cheap (per-patient indexed queries — verified: `procedure_order(patient_id)`, `form_vitals(pid)`, `prescriptions(patient_id)`, `lists(pid)`); the LLM reduce is the only expensive step. So: recompute facts on every read; cache only the narrative, keyed by `(pid, digest(facts ‖ versions))`. Staleness detection stops being a check and becomes cache addressing — serving a narrative over facts that no longer hold is *structurally unreachable*, without knowing or enumerating how data can change.
**Also rejected along the way:**
- *Event-driven invalidation as correctness* — legacy/HL7 write paths don't reliably fire Symfony events; acceptable later as a cache-warming hint only.
- *Triggers / binlog CDC* — correct but mutates host schema / wildly over-budget for an additive module.
- *In-SQL digests (`MD5(GROUP_CONCAT(...))`)* — `group_concat_max_len` defaults to 1024 and silently truncates → false-stable digests. Digest in PHP over fetched rows.
**Residual risk, accepted:** a write landing mid-request means the doc reflects a consistent snapshot taken at extraction time; the next read catches it. Beating that requires locking the EMR's write path — out of scope by the additivity principle.

## T6 — Zero core-table mutation (D5)

**Chosen:** no rows, no columns, no triggers on any existing OpenEMR table. Clinical tables are read-only to the copilot. Module-owned tables carry whatever they need.
**Rejected:** a nullable `updated_at` on core tables (proposed mid-design, withdrawn). App-maintained: never written by legacy/HL7 paths — a decoy future code would trust by mistake. DB-maintained (`ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`): technically sound but a schema mutation of shared clinical tables on a fork tracking upstream — permanent merge liability, and it triggers the host's full `database.sql` + upgrade-file + `v_database` CI discipline. Decisively: **the digest design (T5) exists precisely so no mutation-tracking column is ever needed.** If slice-read performance is ever proven hot, the escalation ladder is: (1) nothing — reads are indexed and per-patient; (2) module-owned event warm-hints; (3) only then the column, through the proper upgrade mechanism, cost accepted with eyes open.

## T7 — Append-only doc store (D6)

**Chosen:** the doc store is write-once, append-only — no UPDATE, no DELETE, no pruning (an earlier "retain last N" idea was cut).
**Why:** history and preservation. Each row is an immutable record of "what the physician was shown over fact-set X." That makes the cache a **provenance ledger**: "what exactly did the physician see before this visit" is a medico-legal question the table answers byte-for-byte, and diffing adjacent rows' fact sets explains why the synthesis changed between visits. Growth is bounded by real fact changes × patients, not by reads.
**Consequences accepted:** digest recurrence (facts A→B→A serves the original row with its honest older generated-at); doc *views* are audited separately via the host's `EventAuditLogger` so the ledger stays pure computation history. **Acknowledged double edge:** the ledger that answers "what was the physician shown" for the defense is equally discoverable by the other side — provenance cuts both ways. Accepted with eyes open: a system that *cannot* show what it told the physician is worse in both roles.

## T8 — Two time axes, never mixed (lab contract C1)

**Chosen:** clinical timeline = specimen collection date (drives trends and overdue math: a three-month-old draw resulted yesterday is a three-month-old data point, and the overdue clock starts at collection). System freshness = the digest, using no dates at all.
**Why:** late arrival was only ever dangerous because the original plan used one axis for both jobs. Separated, the failure mode cannot be expressed.

## T9 — Lab contract positions (C2–C4)

- **Preliminary results: shown, labeled, in the in-flight section** — not hidden (an endocrinologist wants to know a preliminary A1c exists), not a trend point, never resets the overdue clock. The in-flight channel (see T10) is what resolved this: information presented in the channel that says "in progress."
- **Empty-string `result_status` presents (`status: unstated`)** — the schema defaults to `''` and manually-entered labs mostly carry it; excluding it would blank real completed values. The initial objection ("that's a waste") rested on reading `''` as "not ready yet" — but unresulted labs have *no result row at all* (that's T10's territory); `''` rows are completed results with thin metadata.
- **No unit, no math — strict** (after genuine hesitation). A unitless "6.5" A1c is *probably* percent; the strict rule still refuses to trend it, because guessing units is the path that presents an IFCC A1c of 48 as 48%. The cost is made measurable instead of argued: a per-analyte unitless-exclusion-rate counter, with loosening available later as a deliberate, versioned config decision — never a read-time inference.
- **Meta-invariant: no silent exclusion.** Every filtered row appears as a visible "N excluded (reason)" fact with citations. Exclusion is a presented fact, never a disappearance.
- **Out-of-range needs one of exactly two proofs** (parsed value vs. threshold, or the lab's own `abnormal` flag + reported range); conflicts are presented flagged, adjudicated by no one — including the LLM.

## T10 — PendingResults as a fifth capability

**Origin:** user requirement — the endo must know a lab drawn two days ago isn't resulted yet, so they don't re-order.
**Why a capability and not a status rule:** an unresulted lab is a `procedure_order` with **no `procedure_result` rows** — invisible to the result slice by construction, and silence reads as "no recent lab," which *invites* the duplicate order. So absence-of-result became a first-class, deterministic fact (active order + result absent), composing with OverdueTests ("overdue **but specimen already drawn** — do not reorder", asserted only when an active order proves it).

## T11 — Worker as pure cache warmer

**Chosen:** the pre-compute worker (a `background_services` row — the host framework already provides scheduling and lease-locking) only warms the narrative cache; reads never depend on it. Worker failure degrades latency, never correctness.
**Why:** this is what makes the worker severable (the original plan's timebox cut-line survives) and what makes the freshness invariant unconditional.
**Degradation rule (absolute):** LLM unavailable on a cache miss → serve fresh facts with "narrative unavailable"; never serve a narrative whose digest mismatches current facts — stale prose can actively contradict live facts sitting beside it.

## T12 — Additivity as an enforceable invariant, not a principle

"Adding on, not remodeling" is held by three tests (repo-diff empty outside the module dir; module-disabled ⇒ host byte-identical behavior; uninstall drops only module state). Chosen over trusting discipline because the fork's history — like every fork's — is that principles drift and tests don't.

## T13 — Extensibility as spine + gated extension points (weeks 2–3 requirement)

**Context:** later project stages build on this system; extensibility is a requirement, not a nice-to-have.
**Chosen:** a declared **stable spine** (fact model, serializer, digest, append-only ledger, read-path contract, degradation rule, additivity) plus five **gated extension points** (new capability, new doc shape/audience, config changes, new delivery surface, warm-hints) — each with its admission gate and its invalidation story. See the Extension model section of ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md.
**Key forward-compat decision made early because it's cheap now and painful later:** `doc_type` and the reduce prompt/schema version are **digest inputs from v1**, even though v1 has exactly one doc type. This lets week-2/3 doc shapes (a rooming checklist, a deeper synthesis) coexist in the same ledger with correct, independent invalidation — without a digest-scheme migration that would orphan every existing ledger row's addressability.
**Rejected:** "we'll generalize when we need it" — the digest is the one component where retrofitting keys breaks the content-addressing story for all prior rows; everywhere else in the system, generalize-later remains the right call (don't gold-plate).
**Gates worth naming:** new capabilities require a USERS.md use-case row (Stage 4 traceability survives extension); new audiences require their own USERS.md pass (a new user is a new §1–§3, not a bolt-on); anything needing core-table mutation, fact caching, ledger mutation, or LLM access beyond capability-produced fact sets is a spine violation, rejected by the invariant table.

## T14 — Chat agent: preloaded context + capability tools (revises T1's delivery surface, deliberately)

**Context:** the case study's core-interface requirement is a *multi-turn conversational agent that invokes tools* — and the user's real second moment (USERS.md UC6: follow-up drill-downs that today send her back into the four-tab shuffle) independently justifies it. The original "one reduce pass, period" scoping was honest for the synthesis doc but banned tool invocation outright (old anti-extension rule wording, I8's neighborhood). This entry is the reasoning of record for re-opening it.

**Chosen:** a per-patient chat session, **preloaded** with the exact content-addressed doc the physician is reading (canonical fact set + verified narrative), whose only tools are the five deterministic capabilities — JSON-Schema'd, patient-pinned server-side (pid injected by the executor, asserted on every returned fact; no tool accepts a patient argument), chaining bounded (≤5 calls, ≤3 rounds). T1's *core* survives intact: the LLM still never extracts and still adjudicates nothing; it gained navigation (choosing which deterministic query to run), not extraction.
**Rejected:**
- *Free-form SQL / generic retrieval tool* — unbounded, unverifiable, un-citable surface; exactly the extraction T1 exists to ban, now steerable by conversation.
- *RAG over note text* — LLM-side extraction of the least-structured data in the chart; uncheckable citations.
- *Fresh un-preloaded agent per question* — repeats the reduce work on turn 1, pays retrieval latency for questions the synthesis already answers, and loses the "you're talking about the doc you're reading" grounding (fact_digest ties the session to the exact doc version shown).
- *A separate chat product beside the doc* — two surfaces to trust separately; the doc is the first message, not a sibling.
**Consequence:** chat inherits every fact-layer invariant for free (I2 facts-never-cached ⇒ tool results always fresh; I5 exclusions surface in answers; I8 conflicts pass through flagged), and adds I10 (structural pinning) and the chaining budget as its own.
**Sharpened during review into I13 (user decision of record): the LLM is I/O-less — the program pulls everything.** "Tool calling" was always executor-mediated; I13 makes the stronger statement explicit: the model can *request*, never *execute* — no query, no network, no host API, under any output it produces. The program pre-pulls all five capabilities at session seed (before clinic, via the worker), so most follow-ups need zero requests; executor-run requests cover only drill-downs beyond the preloaded envelope. This is also the honest answer to V5's limits: banned *actions* are impossible by construction (there is nothing the model can do, only things it can say), so the lint only has to police *phrasing* — and its paraphrase residual is bounded by evals, not by hope.

## T15 — Verification as a deterministic post-generation gate, not prompt discipline (and not an LLM judge)

**Chosen:** every LLM output — reduce pass and chat turn alike — emits structured claims (`{text, citation_ids[], numeric_values[]}` — plus `claim_type` and `flags[]`, see §2.1; strict schema) and passes six deterministic checks before rendering: schema (V1), citation resolution against the session fact set (V2), **patient-identity guard** — every cited fact's pid must equal the session's pinned pid, re-checked on output even though the tool executor already asserted it on input (V3), numeric grounding — every number in prose must exist in a cited fact after canonicalization (V4), banned-claim lint — causation/recommendation/diagnosis/dosing patterns (V5), conflict passthrough (V6). Fail ⇒ one regeneration with the specific findings ⇒ facts-only degradation. V3 is special-cased as sev-1: no retry, session frozen, alert fired — if pinning failed, the bug is upstream of the LLM and continuing is wrong.
**Rejected:**
- *Prompt discipline as the guarantee* — "the prompt says cite everything" is hope, not architecture; the failure mode it misses (right citation, wrong number) is the clinically dangerous one.
- *LLM-judge as the blocking gate* — a second model as last line of defense is a second hallucination surface; kept as an advisory quality signal feeding evals/dashboards, never the gate. **Sharpened during review (user decision):** the advisory judge is promoted to a *visible* second-pass reviewer — a separate Flash instance re-reads each rendered answer against the session fact set and its concurrence/flags display beside the "citations checked" badge (ARCHITECTURE.md §2.5). Reader-facing signal on exactly the territory the deterministic gate can't cover (emphasis, paraphrase, omission); still never blocking.
- *Verifying only the synthesis path* — chat is the higher-risk path (adversarial input, unbounded question space); one gate, both paths.
**Known limitations, stated in the spec (ARCHITECTURE.md §2.4):** deterministic checks can't catch misleading emphasis, subtly-wrong qualitative paraphrase, or omission — bounded by facts-first rendering, narrative evals, and the advisory judge; not solved.

## T16 — Observability: module-owned trace store, in-app dashboard; no PHI to third-party SaaS

**Chosen:** correlation ID (UUIDv7) minted at every entry point and threaded through every capability call, LLM call, verification verdict, audit entry, and PSR-3 log line; per-step spans in append-only `mod_copilot_trace` — including cache hits, degraded reads, and failures (the original design's blind spot: only LLM misses left a record). Prompts/tool payloads contain PHI, so the trace store lives in the module's tables inside the EMR's MySQL — the same protection domain as the chart — with an ACL-gated, audit-logged in-app dashboard (metrics + click-through to span waterfalls and payloads).
**Rejected:**
- *LangSmith/Langfuse/Braintrust SaaS as primary* — ships PHI-laden prompts to a third party; expands the BAA surface for tooling convenience. A **self-hosted** Langfuse exporter is an optional add-on; the trace table stays the source of truth.
- *Logs-only observability (no trace table)* — can't answer "what happened, in what order, how long" with one indexed query; grep is not a dashboard, and per-request cost rollups need rows, not lines.
- *Metrics without payloads* — a wrong-patient or verification failure is only debuggable with the exact prompt/tool args in hand; payload_ref keeps them one click away.
**Consequence:** the four case-study log questions are answerable from one table by correlation ID alone; alert evaluation (9 alerts incl. the sev-1 V3 trip, the I14 over-stripping alert, and the I15 clean-audit alert) rides the existing background-service tick — no new daemon (consistent with T2's rejection of sidecars); the worker-heartbeat alert alone lives on pull paths, since a dead worker can't report itself.

## T17 — Chat latency: pre-warm covers turn 1; turns 2+ buy freshness with seconds

**Context:** T5/T11's speed-vs-completeness answer (content-addressed cache + worker pre-warm) is built for the one-shot doc; multi-turn responses depend on conversation history and are not content-addressable that way.
**Chosen:** don't force them to be. The preload (T14) makes turn 1 effectively free — the warmed doc *is* the context. Turns 2+ run fresh capability queries (per-patient indexed reads, verified cheap in T5) plus one LLM call, landing in the few-seconds band USERS.md §1 explicitly tolerates for explicit interactions. Uncertainty is communicated, not hidden: tool failures are named in the answer ("vitals lookup failed — answering from labs and meds only"), and the chaining budget degrades transparently rather than silently truncating.
**Rejected:** caching chat responses (keyed on what? history × phrasing — near-zero hit rate, staleness risk returns); speculative pre-answering of predicted follow-ups (cost with no evidence of hit rate — revisit only if trace data shows recurring question shapes); streaming unverified tokens for perceived speed (defeats T15 — the stream shows staged progress, prose renders only post-verification).

## T18 — LLM platform: Google Gemini on Vertex AI, hosted on GCP

**Chosen:** Gemini through **Vertex AI** — Pro tier for synthesis and chat, Flash for the advisory judge — with exact model version strings pinned and folded into `prompt_version` (a digest input: model upgrades invalidate exactly the affected docs, E5 discipline). Structured output via Vertex `responseSchema` constrained decoding; native function calling for the five tools; **context caching** for the session preamble so turns 2+ pay incremental tokens only. Auth by GCP service account (`google/auth`, ADC) — no API keys. Integration is direct Vertex REST via Guzzle against a module-pinned, versioned contract.
**Why this provider surface:** Vertex is HIPAA-eligible under the GCP BAA and the deployment already lives on GCP — one cloud, one BAA, one IAM story. The BAA is the *legal* layer; **egress redaction** (direct identifiers tokenized before any Vertex call, re-hydrated post-verification — ARCHITECTURE.md §4) is the *engineering* layer on top of it, so the compliance story never rests on paper alone. Provider-*enforced* JSON schema materially strengthens V1 (rejection becomes rare instead of retried-often), and context caching is what makes the preloaded-session design (T14) affordable across turns.
**Rejected:**
- *Consumer Gemini API (AI Studio keys)* — no BAA path; disqualified outright for anything touching PHI, and key management is strictly worse than service-account ADC.
- *Anthropic/OpenAI direct* — capable models, but a second vendor relationship and BAA for no architectural gain here; neither changes the design (the verifier assumes nothing provider-specific beyond schema-constrained output, which all majors now offer). Revisit only if eval quality forces it — the model is a pinned, versioned, swappable input by construction.
- *Full Vertex PHP SDK* — its generative surface is thin/lagging; a hand-pinned REST contract is smaller and honest about what we depend on. **Accepted risk:** REST contract drift; mitigated by the pinned version string and the eval suite as a canary on any bump.

## T19 — Mid-conversation staleness: detect and disclose, don't re-pull (user decision of record)

**Context:** the chat session is seeded once with the doc's fact set (T14). If the chart changes mid-conversation, preloaded facts go stale — the same class of failure T5 exists to kill on the synthesis path.
**Chosen:** no automatic re-seed or regeneration per turn. **Rationale (the tradeoff, stated plainly):** re-pulling full context every turn is cost without benefit — a result that landed one minute ago rarely changes the answer to the question being asked, and context re-seeding also discards the conversation the physician is mid-thought in. Instead, every turn runs the *cheap* half of the machinery — fact re-extraction + digest compare (T5's whole point is that this step is inexpensive and LLM-free) — and on drift the answer renders under a visible "chart changed — refresh to re-seed" banner with a one-click fresh session. Tool results are always live regardless (I2). Staleness is therefore *detected and disclosed on every turn*, never silent; what's traded away is only the automatic context mutation.
**Rejected:**
- *Re-seed every turn* — cost and context-window churn per turn, cache-defeating (context caching keys on the stable preamble), and it silently rewrites the ground the conversation stood on.
- *No check at all* — silent staleness; the corrected-lab-mid-chat case is exactly the trust-killer USERS.md §1 names.
- *Auto-regenerate the synthesis on drift* — turns a background data event into a surprise UI change mid-read.
**Supporting spec fix:** `fact_id` now includes the canonical value, so a stale preloaded fact and its corrected re-fetch can coexist unambiguously in the session set (V2 resolution stays deterministic; a value-conflict between them is visible rather than aliased).

## T20 — Scaling: vertical-first, on a resizable server (user decision of record)

**Chosen:** the deployment scales by resizing the machine (GCE machine types: cores, RAM → PHP-FPM worker count), not by replicating the app. **Why:** OpenEMR is a session-holding monolith and the copilot is in-process by design (T2); each open chat connection holds a worker for the turn's duration, so concurrency is a worker-count problem, and worker count is a hardware problem. Horizontal app replicas would immediately buy shared-session storage, sticky connections, and a worker-singleton coordination problem — remodeling the host, which additivity forbids.
**Honest ceiling, named:** the biggest sensible single machine serves the v1 target (a clinic, tens of concurrent clinicians) with room; the R8/R9 load tests convert "how many users per core" from guess to number. Beyond that (multi-clinic/hospital scale): first read replicas for fact extraction, then extracting the chat loop into its own service — a deliberate re-opening of T2 recorded here in advance, so future-us re-litigates a documented decision instead of discovering an accident.

## T21 — Recovery asymmetry: the synthesis is disposable, the conversation is not (user decision of record)

**The principle (full failure model in ARCHITECTURE.md §6):** a summary that fails is a non-event — generation is idempotent and side-effect-free (facts recomputed fresh, ledger append-only, digest-addressed slot), so it is instantly rerun up to a bounded count (default 3, versioned config) with nothing to corrupt and no state to clean up. The territory that actually matters is failure *mid-conversation*: a chat turn is stateful, mid-thought, and non-replayable. **The failsafe is structural, not procedural: the verified summary and the full facts panel sit on the same screen as the chat, and they are served from the ledger and deterministic reads — never from the live LLM.** Any chat failure therefore degrades to a working reference surface the physician cross-checks historical data against; the chat can die, the chart-review job always completes.
**Rejected:**
- *Making chat turns replayable/retryable like the synthesis* — replaying a turn re-runs tools against possibly-changed data under possibly-stale context; a "retried" answer that silently differs from what a retry of the same question *should* say is worse than an honest "turn failed, ask again."
- *Treating all failures uniformly* — spending engineering on synthesis-failure exotica (checkpointing, resumable generation) buys nothing when rerun-from-scratch is free; spending it on chat resilience buys less than the adjacency failsafe already provides. The asymmetry is where the leverage is.
**Consequence:** every §6.2 failure row ends at the same floor by construction, and the capability-crash rule (§6.1: no digest, no ledger write over a partial fact set) exists because the one thing worse than a missing synthesis is a synthesis whose silence about a crashed domain reads as "nothing notable there."

## T22 — Mapping conservation: the over-stripping guard (telemetry promoted to an invariant, user catch)

**Context:** the fact layer strips aggressively — it reads OpenEMR rows/resources and emits only typed, cited facts, discarding everything it doesn't model. That aggression is load-bearing (it's what makes the LLM's input small, verifiable, and PHI-minimized), but it introduces a new, *silent* failure the rest of the design didn't cover: **over-stripping.** If OpenEMR changes a field, or a lab result carries its value in a shape the mapper didn't expect (`valueString` where we assumed `valueQuantity`; a new `result_status`; a row the query assumptions miss), the PHP can drop the entity entirely — 15 source observations quietly become 14 facts — and *nothing errors.*
**Chosen:** make conservation an **invariant (I14)**, not a lone log line. At the mapping boundary, every source entity is accounted for as emitted / excluded-with-reason / `unmapped`, and the counts must balance (`entities_in = facts_out + excluded_n + unmapped_n`). `unmapped_n > 0` is a visible "N unmapped" fact on the doc, a dashboard metric, and an alert — captured on every `extract`/`tool_call` span.
**Why the balance, not a bare before/after count** (the minimal version of the idea): a raw before-vs-after count tells you a number changed but not *which bucket absorbed it*, so it cannot distinguish a legitimate rule-based exclusion (I5) from a silent drop — it either cries wolf on every valid exclusion or gets tuned down until it misses the real loss. The conservation balance separates the three buckets, so the drop is unambiguous and the unrecognized entity's payload is one click away for the fix.
**Why it belongs with I5:** I5 already guarantees "no silent exclusion" for rows the contract *chooses* to drop. Over-stripping is the gap I5 doesn't cover — rows the mapper *never recognized*, which never reach the exclusion accounting. I14 closes exactly that gap; it is the honest counterweight to the aggressiveness the whole extraction philosophy depends on.
**Rejected:**
- *Trust the mapper, no reconciliation* — the failure is invisible by construction; "it worked in the demo" is precisely how schema drift ships a silent data-loss bug into a clinical tool.
- *Fail the whole extraction on any unmapped entity* — too brittle; one weird row shouldn't blank a synthesis. Instead: surface it, keep serving the rest, fix the mapping — the same degrade-visibly-never-silently stance as §6/I6.
**Credit:** raised in review — telemetry was underspecified relative to the rest of the observability story, and the data-mapping layer was the blind spot.

## T23 — LLM cleaning-accuracy audit: content fidelity of the deterministic extraction (user decision of record)

**Context:** I14 conservation proves no entity was *dropped*, but not that each surviving fact is *accurate* — a mapper can keep an entity and still mis-read a field, drop a sub-field, or coerce a value while the counts balance. Requirement: capture pre- and post-clean data, have an LLM check the cleaning for accuracy, store it, and re-run failures up to 3× on the same data.
**Chosen:** a dedicated cleaning-accuracy audit layer (§2.6, I15): pre/post snapshots to an append-only `mod_copilot_clean_audit` table; a Flash auditor (T18) that checks the cleaned facts faithfully represent the raw source; extract→audit retry ≤3× (same bound as the synthesis retry); persistent failure quarantines the entity as a visible `suspect` fact + alert.
**Why an LLM here does not break T1:** the auditor *checks*, it does not *extract* — it produces no facts and never touches the chart, exactly the auditor role §2's verifier plays over narration. Deterministic PHP remains the sole producer of facts; the LLM is a second opinion on that producer's fidelity.
**Why re-run deterministic cleaning at all** (a fair objection — same input, same output): the retry is not expected to *change* a correct-but-flagged result; it clears the two *recoverable* causes — a transient partial read (re-read succeeds) and a flaky auditor verdict (Flash nondeterminism resolves on repeat). A *persistent* failure across 3 attempts is therefore strong evidence of a real cleaning bug or genuinely ambiguous source — exactly when quarantine-and-alert, not another retry, is correct.
**Cost, faced honestly:** this adds an LLM call per audited extraction — real spend. Mitigations: it rides the **warm worker path** (zero physician-facing latency), uses **Flash** (cheapest tier), is **cadence-configurable** (per-extraction default, sampling when tuning), and is bounded by the §3.7 spend caps. It is the deliberate price of clinical-grade cleaning fidelity, and its per-tier cost is modeled in the AI cost analysis.
**Rejected:**
- *Trust deterministic cleaning without a content audit* — I14 catches drops and V4 catches bad numbers in prose, but neither catches a mis-mapped-but-*surviving* value at the extraction boundary; that gap is exactly where a wrong lab value reaches the physician looking fully cited.
- *Make the auditor a blocking gate on the read path* — adds an LLM call to physician-facing latency and a hallucination surface to the critical path; instead it runs warm and quarantines async, so reads never wait on it.
- *Infinite retry* — masks real bugs and burns spend; the bound is 3-then-quarantine, consistent with every other retry in the system (I11, synthesis, verification).
**Layering:** three independent fidelity guards at three boundaries — I14 (entity survival) → I15/§2.6 (cleaning content) → V1–V6 (narration). A silent data error must beat all three.
