# Clinical Co-Pilot I9 additivity gate -- repo-diff test 1
# (ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md "Additivity invariant (enforced, see U9)": "1.
# Repo diff outside the module directory (and the case-study root docs) is
# empty.").
#
# Fails (exit 1) if the diff between a base ref and the current working tree
# touches ANY file outside interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-clinical-copilot/
# other than the whitelisted case-study root docs (ALLOWED_SPEC_DOCS below:
# README.md, AUDIT.md, USERS.md/USER.md, ARCHITECTURE.md,
# ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md, docs/clinical-copilot-tradeoffs.md -- the
# submission deliverables the case study requires at the repo root). Also
# fails on any new, untracked file outside those paths -- a brand-new file is
# just as much an additivity violation as a modified one.
#
# Usage:
#   ops/ci/check-additivity.sh [base-ref]
#
# base-ref resolution order: the first CLI argument, then $ADDITIVITY_BASE_REF,
# then origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF (set automatically by GitHub Actions on
# pull_request events), then origin/master, then master. Comparison is against
# the merge-base of that ref and HEAD (not the ref's tip), so a base branch
# that has moved on since this branch forked does not produce false positives
# for commits that landed on the base branch after the fork point.
#
# CI invocation -- this gate is wired into PR-blocking CI by
# .github/workflows/w2-eval-gate.yml, the one intentional core-workflow
# addition (itself whitelisted in ALLOWED_SPEC_DOCS below so it does not
# trip the very invariant it enforces). To also run it locally, from the
# repo root, before opening a PR:
#
#   interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-clinical-copilot/ops/ci/check-additivity.sh origin/master
#
# See docs/clinical-copilot-tradeoffs.md / ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md for why
# this invariant exists, and the module README for the full list of CI gates
# (this script + the PHPStan forbidden-write rule, see
# ../../phpstan.neon and ../../tests/PHPStan/Rules/).
