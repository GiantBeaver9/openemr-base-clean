/**
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §1.1: "the session is preloaded with the exact
 * content-addressed doc the physician is reading ... turn 1 therefore needs
 * zero retrieval." build-notes.md's guidance for this build unit is "seed
 * chat from the stored doc row; do NOT re-run the read-path orchestrator
 * mid-turn" -- the "mid-turn" qualifier is the operative word: this class
 * calls {@see SynthesisReadPath::read()} exactly ONCE, at session-creation
 * time, which is the identical, idempotent, free-by-construction (T21) read
 * `public/doc.php` already performs when the physician opens the synthesis
 * page moments before opening the chat panel beside it -- it is emphatically
 * NOT invoked again per chat turn (see {@see AgentLoop}, which only ever
 * calls capability `extract*()` methods directly, never this seeder or
 * `SynthesisReadPath`).
 *
 * A capability crash (`SynthesisReadResult::$capabilityCrash`) means no doc
 * row exists to seed from -- session creation is refused in that case
 * (the physician sees the same "synthesis paused" banner `doc.php` already
 * shows; chat has nothing safe to preload from a partial fact set either).
