/**
 * Confidence here is NOT the model's self-reported certainty (which is
 * unreliable and un-auditable) -- it is a deterministic function of how the
 * turn cleared the deterministic V1-V6 gate ({@see ChatAgent}): a turn that
 * verified on the first attempt is high-confidence; one that only verified
 * after the single fail-closed regeneration is reduced; a degraded turn (the
 * verifier could not clear an answer, or the LLM was unreachable) carries no
 * meaningful confidence; a frozen turn (V3 patient-identity sev-1) is blocked.
 *
 * Pure over the {@see ChatAnswer} -- same answer always yields the same
 * confidence -- so it is safe to persist on the turn, surface to the UI, and
 * emit to the audit/observability log for oversight.
